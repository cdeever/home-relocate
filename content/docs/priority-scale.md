# Priority Scale

How we rank features when evaluating homes.

| Rating | Name | Description |
|:------:|------|-------------|
| ★ | **Deal Breaker** | Non-negotiable. If the home lacks this feature, we walk away regardless of other qualities. |
| ● | **Must Have** | Required for serious consideration. Missing this makes the home a hard sell. |
| ◐ | **Nice to Have** | Desired but flexible. Adds value but we can live without it. |
| ○ | **Indifferent** | No strong preference either way. Doesn't factor into the decision. |
| ⛔ | **Reject** | Presence of this is a deal-breaker. Examples: foundation issues, HOA restrictions we can't accept, unworkable layout. |
| ↻ | **Willing to Renovate** | Feature not required as-is. Open to adding or upgrading post-purchase. |

## How We Use This

1. **Sweetie** and **Chris** each rank every feature independently
2. When evaluating a house, we check each feature against our rankings
3. A house with any ★ missing or any ⛔ present is eliminated
4. Remaining houses are scored by how many ● and ◐ items they satisfy
