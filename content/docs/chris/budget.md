# Budget & Financing

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hard Equity** | $310-320k (from current home sale) |
| **Stretch Capacity** | Additional cash or equity loan available |
| **Ownership Model** | 50/50 equity split |

## Preferred Budget
$620-640k purchase (hard equity only, assuming matched contribution). Strongly prefer home fully paid or minimal mortgage (under $30-50k owed).

## Maximum Budget
$700k if stretching with additional funds. This is a compromise—lower is better.

## Flexibility
Would consider $550k purchase + $100k renovation budget if:
- Exceptional location
- Standout feature that's hard to find elsewhere
