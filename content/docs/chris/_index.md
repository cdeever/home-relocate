# Chris's Wishes

What matters most to Chris in our new home.

## Priority Scale

| Rating | Meaning |
|:------:|---------|
| ★ | **Deal Breaker** - Must exist or we walk |
| ● | **Must Have** - Required |
| ◐ | **Nice to Have** - Desired but flexible |
| ○ | **Indifferent** - No strong preference |
| ⛔ | **Reject** - Presence is a deal-breaker |

---

## Budget & Financing

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hard Equity** | $310-320k (from current home sale) |
| **Stretch Capacity** | Additional cash or equity loan available |
| **Ownership Model** | 50/50 equity split |

### Preferred Budget
$620-640k purchase (hard equity only, assuming matched contribution). Strongly prefer home fully paid or minimal mortgage (under $30-50k owed).

### Maximum Budget
$700k if stretching with additional funds. This is a compromise—lower is better.

### Flexibility
Would consider $550k purchase + $100k renovation budget if:
- Exceptional location
- Standout feature that's hard to find elsewhere
